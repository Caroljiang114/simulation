## What is an R package? 
  - It's just a collection of functions that you want use over and over again.  
  - That's it.  

## What is the structure of an R package? 
  - File: DESCRIPTION
  - File: NAMESPACE
  - Folder: man
  - Folder: R
  
## DESCRIPTION
  - Stores metadata about the package

Package: Package Name

Type: Package

Title: What the Package Does (Title Case)

Version: 0.1.0

Author: Who wrote it

Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>

Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
    

## NAMESPACE
  - Specifies which functions your package makes available for others to use and, optionally, imports functions from other packages.

## Folder: man
  - This is where the help files exist. 
  - These are called .Rd files

## Folder: R
  - This is where the code goes.
  - These are .R files
  - Usually, we try to create one .R file for each function, but you don't HAVE to do this.  

## Creating R packages
  - In R Studio, you can start a new project and create an R Package skeleton automatically. 
  - Let's do this now and look at what gets created.

## Putting our package on github
  - Create a github repo
  - Connect your github repo to an R project
  - Move the package skeleton to the local git folder
  - Push to github

## Installing a package from github

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "gjm112/christmas")
library(christmas)
help(hello)
```

## Exercise
  - Let's do three things: 
    1. Create an R Package to generate a secret santa list
    2. Put it on Github
    3. Install the package from Github.
